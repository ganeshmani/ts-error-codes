### Code: 1002. Unterminated string literal

There is an unterminated string literal somewhere. String literals must be enclosed by single (') or double (") quotes. JavaScript makes no distinction between single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings. Escape sequences work in strings created with either single or double quotes. To fix this error, check if:

you have opening and closing quotes (single or double) for your string literal,
you have escaped your string literal correctly,
your string literal isn't split across multiple lines.

```ts
const longString: string = 'This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.';
// SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
```

We can solve this problem in typescript using

```ts
const longString: string = `This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.`;
```
