### Code: 1003. Identifier expected


[Identifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier) are the name that you give to your variables, functions etc. It's the official term for them and carries with it the rules for which characters are valid within them.

#### Issue 1:

In most cases, though, an identifier cannot be the same name as a [reserved word](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp) â€“ the names used by the language itself, such as control structures (if, for, etc.).


```js
let for;
// SyntaxError at `for`
```

throw is one such reserved word, which represents a statement for raising custom errors, and cannot be used as a variable defined by import.

To get around this, you can specify your own name/identifier (alias) for your imports

#### Issue 2:

If typescript can not find the variable inside the object, it throws `Identifier expected error`. For example, an object `obj` with `name`,

```ts
const obj = {
    name: "typescript"
}
```

when you try to access the object with bracket notation like below

```ts
console.log(obj.["name"])
```

you will see an error `Identifier expected error`. because it's using dot and bracket notation together. we need to use either dot notation or bracket notation.

```ts
console.log(obj.name)

console.log(obj['name'])
```
